CS 412 Longest Path - Solution Comparison Guide
================================================

This guide explains how to compare the exact and approximation solutions
for both runtime (speed) and accuracy (solution quality).

QUICK START
-----------

1. Run detailed comparison (generates data for plots):
   bash compare_solutions_detailed.sh

2. View results:
   cat comparison_data.txt
   cat comparison_summary.txt

3. Generate visualization plots:
   python3 plot_comparison.py

COMPARISON SCRIPTS
------------------

1. compare_solutions.sh
   - Interactive comparison with detailed output
   - Shows runtime and solution quality for each test
   - Good for quick manual comparisons
   
   Usage: bash compare_solutions.sh

2. compare_solutions_detailed.sh
   - Generates data files for analysis and plotting
   - Runs on multiple test cases automatically
   - Creates comparison_data.txt and comparison_summary.txt
   
   Usage: bash compare_solutions_detailed.sh

3. plot_comparison.py
   - Creates visualization plots from comparison data
   - Shows 4 plots: runtime comparison, solution quality, speedup, quality table
   - Requires matplotlib (will show text table if not available)
   
   Usage: python3 plot_comparison.py

OUTPUT FILES
------------

comparison_data.txt:
  - Detailed data for each test case
  - Format: test_name|vertices|edges|exact_time|approx_time|exact_value|approx_value|quality|diff|percent|speedup
  - Can be used for custom analysis or plotting

comparison_summary.txt:
  - Summary statistics
  - Total tests, optimal count, suboptimal count
  - Average speedup factor

solution_comparison.png / solution_comparison.pdf:
  - Visualization plots (generated by plot_comparison.py)
  - Shows runtime comparison, solution quality, speedup factors

WHAT THE COMPARISON SHOWS
--------------------------

Runtime Comparison:
  - How much faster the approximation is vs exact solution
  - Speedup factor (exact_time / approx_time)
  - Demonstrates polynomial time vs exponential time

Solution Quality:
  - Whether approximation found optimal solution (OPTIMAL)
  - Or suboptimal solution (SUBOPTIMAL)
  - Difference in path length
  - Percentage below optimal

Example Output:
  test_large_1: Exact=112, Approx=111, Quality=SUBOPTIMAL, Diff=1, Percent=0.89%
  - Shows approximation was 0.89% below optimal
  - Speedup: 0.88x (approximation was slightly slower on this small test, but will be much faster on large graphs)

USING FOR PART D PRESENTATION
------------------------------

The comparison data and plots can be used in Part D (Approximation Presentation) to show:

1. Runtime Performance:
   - Use comparison_data.txt to create plots showing exact vs approx runtime
   - Demonstrate polynomial time performance of approximation

2. Solution Quality:
   - Show cases where approximation finds optimal solutions
   - Show cases where approximation is suboptimal
   - Discuss the trade-off between speed and accuracy

3. Speedup Analysis:
   - Show how much faster approximation is on different graph sizes
   - Note that speedup increases dramatically for larger graphs

TIPS
----

- For small graphs, exact solution may be faster (overhead of approximation)
- For larger graphs, approximation will be dramatically faster
- Run multiple times with different seeds to see variation in approximation quality
- Use test_nonoptimal to demonstrate suboptimal cases

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

If comparison script fails:
- Make sure both exact_solution and approx_solution folders exist
- Check that test cases exist in approx_solution/test_cases/
- Ensure bc is installed: `which bc` (required for calculations)

If plots don't generate:
- Install matplotlib: `pip install matplotlib numpy` or `conda install matplotlib numpy`
- The script will still show text output if matplotlib is not available
